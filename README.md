# Engine-Simulator

To better my understanding of coding while designing an engine simulator based on Ardustim.
  Goals
  1. To be able to select trigger patterns without the use of a PC
  2. Retain compatibility with triggers already used in Ardustim.
  3. Retain compatibility with Arduino boards already used in Ardustim.
